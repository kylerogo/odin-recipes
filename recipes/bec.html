    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The sandwich you make your family for breakfast, or even lunch and dinner. Use whatever bread and cheese you have in your pantry or fridge.</p>
    <p>Many New Yorkers will start their day with a bacon, egg and cheese sandwich - also known as the <em>"hangover cure"</em>.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>ciabatta rolls (or any bread you may have)</li>
        <li>unsalted butter</li>
        <li>bacon</li>
        <li>eggs</li>
        <li>kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded cheese (ow whatever you may have)</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice the rolls in half horizontally. Heat a heavy pan, such as cast iron, over medium high heat and melt 2 teaspoons of the butter. Place the roll cut sides down in the pan, and let the halves sizzle until the bottoms turn golden, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove and set aside.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Place the bacon in the pan over medium high heat and cook until it is crispy, about 4 minutes on each side. Remove the bacon to a paper towel lined plate, pour off any fat left in the pan and (carefully; that pan is hot!) use a wad of paper towels to wipe out the inside of the pan.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Crack the eggs in a bowl and lightly beat them with the salt and pepper. Melt the remaining 2 teaspoons butter in the pan. Pour in the eggs and as the bottom sets use a spatula to lift up the edges of the eggs and let the uncooked eggs run underneath. When the bottom is almost cooked but the top is still slightly wet sprinkle over the cheese. Let the eggs cook for another minute, then fold the sides of the eggs over the middle, so that it takes on a rectangular omelet shape. Slide the omelet out of the pan onto a cutting board and cut in half, so that each piece takes on a similar shape to the ciabatta rolls.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Place the cooked eggs on the bottom of the browned roll. Place the bacon on top of the eggs, give it all a loving squirt of Sriracha or other hot sauce, and cover with the top of the roll.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Serve the sandwich warm, and take 10 minutes out of your day and read a magazine, and think of this moment warmly all week.</li>
